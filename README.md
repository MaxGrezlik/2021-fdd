# 2021 FDD Openscapes Champions Cohort

Welcome to the 2021 FDD Openscapes Champions Cohort! This is a Cohort for Fisheries Dependent Data users (FDD). Learn more about Openscapes and the Champions Program: <https://openscapes.org>. 

## Cohort Agendas

We will meet as a Cohort via Zoom four times over two months for 1.5 hours, on alternating Fridays in September and October 2020. Additionally, we will schedule several GitHub Clinics before Call 2. 

- **Dates: September 17, October 1, 15 & 29**
- **Times: 12:00-1:30 pm EDT**
- **Location: Remotely, via Zoom**

Agenda links below are only accessible to Cohort participants (TODO), as they are also an archive of our live google-docing. Please see <https://openscapes.org/series> for more detail and to view blank versions of the agendas.

## More about FDD

**Fishery Dependent Data (FDD) **represent a complex mix of information collected to facilitate managing the region's living marine resources. In the Northeast, data flow from individual businesses and/or scientific samplers to the region's scientific and management organizations. This web of information can be difficult to access as much of the content is confidential in its raw form. Further, many of the codes and systems used to store these data are poorly documented, and even routine analyses are not commonly shared among data users. Currently, FDD are therefore difficult to integrate into scientific advice for ecosystem based fisheries management. Analysts tend to be unfamiliar with the data or hesitant to explore their potential, and data can be viewed with skepticism rather than leveraged in new and innovative ways. There is a need to begin to provide access, documentation, and cultivate a community of practice that focuses on using these data to their full potential.

**This opportunity is funded through NOAA Fisheries Northeast Fisheries Science Center ([NEFSC](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northeast-fisheries-science-center)) and a grant from the [Fisheries Information System Program](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/commercial-fishing/fisheries-information-system-program) through an award to [UMass Dartmouth-SMAST](https://www.umassd.edu/smast/) through [CINAR](http://www.cinar.org/).** It is coordinated by Gavin Fay (UMassD-SMAST), Andy Jones (NOAA NEFSC), and Rachel Baum (UMassD Claire T. Carney Library).
